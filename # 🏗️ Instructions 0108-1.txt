BRIDGE FROM TESTED_BRIDGE_GAD FOLDER


ridge Module Development Plan
Based on my analysis of the Tested_Bridge_GAD folder, I'll outline the approach for developing the Bridge module:

Key Components to Implement:
Input Parameters (from input.xlsx):
Bridge geometry (spans, width, skew)
Deck details (thickness, overhangs)
Abutment and pier details
Foundation details
Material properties
Core Functionality:
Bridge elevation generation
Plan view generation
Cross-section generation
DXF export with proper layering
Quantity takeoff calculations
UI Components:
Form for input parameters
Interactive preview
DXF export button
Report generation
Implementation Steps:
Create bridge.py module with:
Input parameter definitions
Geometry calculation functions
DXF generation using ezdxf
Report generation
Integrate with main app:
Add to sidebar navigation
Connect UI to backend functions
Add error handling and validation
Testing:
Validate against existing GAD outputs
Test various bridge configurations
Verify DXF exports
Would you like me to start implementing the Bridge module? I can begin with:

Setting up the basic module structure
Implementing the input form
Adding the DXF generation functions
Please let me know your preference, and if you have any specific requirements or modifications to this approach.
